A stylized, vibrant cherry with a subtle twist: the cherry is slightly rotated 15 degrees, with a glossy red skin and a single green leaf at the top. The background is a soft gradient from light pink to deep magenta, giving the cherry a dynamic, eye‑catching appearance. The cherry should appear slightly raised, with a subtle shadow to emphasize depth.
